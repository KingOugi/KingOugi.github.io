        <h3>Breakfast</h3>

        <h1>Banana Bread Pancakes</h1>

        <p>
            Fluffy, cozy, and full of banana bread flavor, these pancakes are 
            the perfect weekend treat. The edges get golden and buttery while
            the centers stay soft and full of melty chocolate chips. Stack them
            high, drizzle with maple syrup, and watch them disappear in seconds.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, mash the ripe bananas until mostly smooth with
                a few small chunks left.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk in the egg, melted butter, vanilla extract, and buttermilk
                until combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, brown sugar,
                baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and gently fold until just
                combined. Do not overmix.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over medium heat and add butter
                to melt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scoop about 1/2 cup of batter for each pancake. Sprinkle walnuts
                and chocolate chips on top before flipping.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook until bubbles form and edges look set, then flip and cook 
                until golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer to a plate and repeat with remaining batter, adding 
                more butter as needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve warm with butter, maple syrup, and extra chocolate chips.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips &amp; Notes</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Can I use oil instead of butter?</b><br />
            You can, but the pancakes won’t be as flavorful. Butter browns as 
            it cooks, giving a richer taste.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>How can I make them taste more like banana bread?</b><br />
            Add thin banana slices on top of the batter before flipping. 
            They caramelize beautifully.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>What if I don’t have buttermilk?</b><br />
            Combine 1 cup of milk with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar 
            and let it sit for 5 minutes.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Can I save leftovers?</b><br />
            Yes! Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days 
            or freeze with parchment paper between pancakes.
