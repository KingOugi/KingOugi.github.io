            <b>Synopsis:</b>
            The Thing is a science-fiction horror film set at a remote Antarctic
            research station. After discovering a mysterious alien organism
            capable of perfectly imitating humans, the team begins to turn on
            one another as paranoia and fear grow. With no way to know who is
            still human, survival becomes a deadly psychological battle in the
            frozen isolation.

            <b>Synopsis:</b>
            Green Book is a drama inspired by true events, following a classical
            pianist and his driver as they travel across the segregated American
            South in the 1960s. Relying on the “Green Book,” a guide for safe
            travel, the two men face discrimination, cultural differences, and
            personal challenges. Over time, their journey leads to
            understanding, respect, and an unexpected friendship.
